# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:

  assets:
  - .env
  - assets/fonts/
  - assets/images/
  # - assets/pdfs/

  fonts:
    - family: PlusJakartaSans
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/PlusJakartaSans-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/PlusJakartaSans-Italic.ttf
          style: italic

        - asset: assets/fonts/PlusJakartaSans-Bold.ttf

    - family: Inter
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-VariableFont_opsz,wght.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-Italic-VariableFont_opsz,wght.ttf
          style: italic

        # - asset: fonts/PlusJakartaSans-Bold.ttf
        #   weight: 600
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
